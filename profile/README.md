## Bitnet

[Open Repository üîç](https://github.com/BitnetMoney/bitnet)

This repository houses the primary implementation of the Bitnet client in Golang. Any significant changes must undergo the BTIP (Bitnet Improvement Proposal) process to be incorporated into the main Bitnet codebase, but we encourage anyone to submit suggestions and provide feedback on the main code.

## Bitnet Desktop Node Client

[Open Repository üîç](https://github.com/BitnetMoney/bitnet-desktop-node)

Bitnet Desktop Node is the desktop software designed for running Bitnet Nodes. It includes built-in features such as a miner, wallet, console, and a user-friendly GUI, making it effortless to set up and manage nodes with just a few clicks. This user-friendly approach streamlines interaction with the network for both users and developers, and it's exclusive to Bitnet. The software also offers a high degree of customization for nodes, making it an ideal choice for miners, exchanges, developers, and general users. This is a "self-contained" software, meaning that you can download and use it in replacement of the Bitnet primary Golang client implementation.

## Bitnet Improvement Proposals (BTIPs)

[Open Repository üîç](https://github.com/BitnetMoney/btips)

This repository is for Bitnet Improvement Proposals (BTIPS), which are formal documents proposing improvements to the Bitnet Protocol. The BTIPS process is modelled after Bitcoin's BIPs and Ethereum's EIPs systems, aiming to provide a standardized way for individuals and organizations to contribute to the development of Bitnet.

## Public Brand Kit

[Open Repository üîç](https://github.com/BitnetMoney/public-brand-kit)

A compilation of assets and resources for community content creation for Bitnet. This is an open source repository and anyone can contribute by submitting their own assets or making improvement suggestions.

## Contract Standards

[Open Repository üîç](https://github.com/BitnetMoney/contract-standards)

This repository provides a set of contract standards developed by Bitnet to facilitate the creation of secure and interoperable smart contracts on the Bitnet blockchain. These standards are designed to enhance security, control, and usability within the Bitnet decentralized ecosystem.

## Bitnet Papers

[Open Repository üîç](https://github.com/BitnetMoney/bitnet-papers)

This repository is an archive with Bitnet's papers, including the original whitepaper and its subsequent updates. Translations are welcome.
